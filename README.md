## Quickstart

Once everything is installed, you can now use this example to get started with
a new `app.php` file:

```php
<?php

require __DIR__ . '/../vendor/autoload.php';

$app = new FrameworkX\App();

$app->get('/', function () {
    return new React\Http\Message\Response(
        200,
        [],
        "Hello wörld!\n"
    );
});

$app->get('/users/{name}', function (Psr\Http\Message\ServerRequestInterface $request) {
    return new React\Http\Message\Response(
        200,
        [],
        "Hello " . $request->getAttribute('name') . "!\n"
    );
});

$app->run();
```

That's it already! The next step is now to serve this web application.
One of the nice properties of this project is that is works both behind
traditional web server setups as well as in a stand-alone environment.

For example, you can run the above example using PHP's built-in webserver for
testing purposes like this:

```bash
$ php -S 0.0.0.0:8080 app.php
```

You can now use your favorite webbrowser or command line tool to check your web
application responds as expected:

```bash
$ curl -v http://localhost:8080/
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
…

Hello wörld!
```
